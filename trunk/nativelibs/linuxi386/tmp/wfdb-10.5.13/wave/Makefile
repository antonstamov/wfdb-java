# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to compile and install WAVE.
# WAVE can be compiled and run only on UNIX systems, although any networked
# system with an X11 server can be used to view its output;  suitable servers
# are available for MS-DOS, the Macintosh, and VAX VMS as well as UNIX.
# In order to compile WAVE, you must have already installed the X11 Xlib
# (libX11.a), XView (libxview.a), and WFDB (libwfdb.a) libraries, and their
# associated header files (in /usr/include/X11, /usr/include/xview, and
# /usr/include/ecg respectively).  The WFDB library source is included with the
# WAVE distribution (in the `lib' directory at the same level as this one).
# Xlib and XView are freely available by anonymous FTP as parts of the X11R4
# distribution from expo.lcs.mit.edu and other sites, or from the MIT Software
# Distribution Center, MIT Room E32-300, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; telephone
# +1-617-253-6966.  See the main help file (wave.hl0, in this directory) for
# further information.
#
# Before using this file for the first time, check that the site-specific
# variables below are appropriate for your system.  To build and install WAVE,
# just type `make' (from within this directory).

# 'make' definitions for compiling the WFDB Software Package under Linux

# Choose a value for WFDBROOT to determine where the WFDB Software Package will
# be installed.  One of the following is usually a reasonable choice.
# Installing in /usr generally requires root permissions, but will be easiest
# for future software development (no special -I or -L options will be needed
# to compile software with the WFDB library, since the *.h files and the
# library will be installed in the standard directories).
WFDBROOT = /home/ikaro/workspace/wfdb-java/nativelibs/linuxi386/
# Installing in /usr/local usually requires root permissions.  On a multi-user
# system where it is desirable to keep the OS vendor's software separate from
# other software, this is a good choice.  Another common choice in such cases
# is /opt .
# WFDBROOT = /usr/local
# To install without root permissions, a good choice is to set WFDBROOT to the
# name of your home directory, as in the example below (change as needed).
# WFDBROOT = /home/frodo

# LC and LL are used to determine C compiler and linker options needed to
# enable NETFILES (code that allows applications linked to the WFDB library to
# read input from HTTP and FTP servers, in addition to the standard filesystem
# support available without NETFILES).  The WFDB library can use either
# libcurl (recommended) or libwww to provide NETFILES support.  To use libcurl,
# set LC to `curl-config --cflags` (note the backquotes) and LL to
# `curl-config --libs`.  Otherwise, to use libwww, set LC to
# `libwww-config --cflags` and LL to `libwww-config --libs`.  If neither
# libcurl nor libwww is available, LC and LL should be empty (and NETFILES
# will be disabled).
LC =
LL =

# BINDIR specifies the directory in which the applications will be installed;
# it should be a directory in the PATH of those who will use the applications.

# DBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the contents
# of the `data' directory.

# INFODIR is the GNU info directory (optional, needed to `make info').
INFODIR = $(WFDBROOT)/share/info

# LIBDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the WFDB
# library.

# MANDIR is the root of the man page directory tree.  On most systems, this is
# something like /usr/man or /usr/local/man (type 'man man' to find out).

# PSPDIR specifies the name of a directory in which to install the PostScript
# prolog (*.pro) files from the 'app' directory.

# CC is the name of your C compiler.
CC = gcc

# CCDEFS is the set of C compiler options needed to set preprocessor variables
# while compiling the WFDB Software Package.  CCDEFS should always include
# VDEFS (the version definitions).  Under Linux, -fno-stack-protector is needed
# when compiling the WFDB Toolkit for Matlab;  it's harmless otherwise.
CCDEFS = $(VDEFS) -fno-stack-protector

# MFLAGS is the set of architecture-dependent (-m*) compiler options, which
# is usually empty.  See the gcc manual for information about gcc's -m options.
MFLAGS =

# CFLAGS is the set of C compiler options.  CFLAGS should always include
# CCDEFS.
CFLAGS = $(MFLAGS) -g -O $(CCDEFS) $(LC) -I$(INCDIR)

# LDFLAGS is appended to the C compiler command line to specify loading the
# WFDB library.
LDFLAGS = -L$(LIBDIR) -lwfdb $(LL)

# WFDBLIB is the name of the standard WFDB library.  In order to access it via
# `-lwfdb', WFDBLIB should be `libwfdb.a'.
WFDBLIB = libwfdb.a

# BUILDLIB is the command that creates the static WFDB library once its
# components have been compiled separately;  the list of *.o files that
# make up the library will be appended to BUILDLIB.
BUILDLIB = $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $(WFDBLIB)

# PRINT is the name of the program used to produce listings (including any
# options for the desired formatting).
PRINT = lpr

# SETPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the installed files accessible
# to those who will use them.  The value given below makes them readable by
# everyone, and writeable by the owner only.  (If you perform the installation
# as `root', `root' is the owner of the installed files.)
SETPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETDPERMISSIONS is similarly used to make directories created during the
# installation accessible.
SETDPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# SETLPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the WFDB library usable by
# programs linked to it.
SETLPERMISSIONS = chmod 644

# SETXPERMISSIONS is the command needed to make the applications accessible.
SETXPERMISSIONS = chmod 755

# STRIP is the command used to compact the compiled binaries by removing their
# symbol tables.

# To retain the symbol tables for debugging, comment out the previous line, and
# uncomment the next line.
# STRIP = :

XHOME = /usr/X11R6

# XINCDIR is the directory in which the 'X11' directory containing X11 *.h
# files is found.  This is usually /usr/X11R6/include, although there is often
# a link connecting /usr/include/X11 to this directory.
XINCDIR = $(XHOME)/include

# XLIBDIR is the directory in which the X11 libraries are found.
XLIBDIR = $(XHOME)/lib

# WCFLAGS is the set of C compiler options to use when compiling WAVE.
WCFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -I$(OWINCDIR) -I$(XINCDIR) -fno-stack-protector

# HELPOBJ can be set to "help.o" if you wish to recompile the XView spot help
# functions in "wave/help.c" (recommended under Linux).
HELPOBJ = help.o
# Otherwise, use the version in libxview by uncommenting the next line:

# WLDFLAGS is the set of loader options appended to the C compiler command line
# to specify loading the WFDB, XView, and Xlib libraries.
WLDFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) -L$(OWLIBDIR) -L$(XLIBDIR) -lxview -lolgx -lX11

# WLDFLAGS = $(LDFLAGS) -L$(XLIBDIR) $(OWLIBDIR)/libxview.a \
#  $(OWLIBDIR)/libolgx.a -lX11

# Change the settings below as appropriate for your setup.

# Choose directories in which to install WAVE and its ancillary files by
# editing the variables below.  You will need write permission in all of them
# in order to install WAVE successfully, and WAVE users will need read
# permission in all of them.  If the directories don't exist already, they
# will be created with appropriate permissions by the installation procedure.

# This section of site-dependent variables specifies the locations in your
# file system where the WAVE software and data files will be installed.
# You may choose a different set of locations if you prefer, but documentation
# included in this package generally assumes that you have used the defaults
# given here.  You will need write permission in all of the directories named
# in this section, and users of the software will need read permission in all
# of these directories.  Generally, you will need `root' permissions in order
# to install the software in the standard places.

# HELPDIR specifies the directory in which the on-line help files are kept.
# The installation procedure creates a subdirectory, `wave', in HELPDIR, and
# installs several files there.

# MENUDIR specifies the directory in which the default analysis menu file is

# RESDIR specifies the directory in which X11 client resource files are kept.
